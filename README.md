# -GreenspotDataset
Design and implemention a relational database in MySQL Workbench, ensuring data accuracy and efficient querying.

To complete my project, I followed a systematic approach:

Dataset Review: I carefully reviewed the provided dataset to understand its structure and identify entities.

Database Design: Using MySQL Workbench, I designed tables with appropriate fields, ensuring each table had a primary key and relationships were established where necessary.

Table Creation: I manually created these tables in the database, ensuring they matched my design and had the correct data types and constraints.

Data Loading: I loaded sample data from the dataset into the tables to populate them for testing purposes.

Query Testing: I wrote and tested SQL queries to ensure the database design could handle complex queries and provide accurate results.

Documentation: Finally, I documented my database design and the steps taken to create it for future reference.
